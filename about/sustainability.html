  <h4>Sustainability focus</h4>
  <p>
    In 2007 Strategic Data undertook a Carbon Audit, engaging EcoVantage to consult to this project.<br>
    The EcoVantage assessment offered several strategies for reducing the company&rsquo;s environmental impact. Strategic Data has successfully responded to many of these suggestions, introducing a number of reduction strategies and responses in the following areas:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reducing electricity usage through changes to office environment, lighting and heating systems</li>
    <li>Sourcing electricity from hydro supplier Red Energy (supply is emissions-free when sourced by hydro-electric means)</li>
    <li>Facilitation of increased use of bicycles for staff travel to and from work, including installation of additional bike racks, and a shower available for staff to help facilitate bicycle travel</li>
    <li>Use of public transport for the majority of travel down within business hours</li>
    <li>Increased use of phone conferencing system allowing conferencing with multiple external attendees</li>
