Founded in 1996, Strategic Data has always prided itself on the intelligent
application of information technology. We have a long history of working with
state-of-the-art data and web technologies, often with an open source focus.

In our early days our data-focussed services encompassed data entry,
scanning, analysis, reporting, and bulk data processing. We have evolved along
with the evolution of technology and changing customer requirements and
nowadays we specialise in the delivery of data driven web solutions with a
strong focus on usability and accessability. We consult with clients to
identify data issues, scope solutions and deliver achievable roadmaps that
position for future data opportunities and growth. We host, support, maintain
and adapt the systems we develop.

Our people's expertise ranges across management, project management,
systems administration, programming, analysis, front-end design, survey design,
and applied psychology. Our developers all work in-house as part of a team of
more than 20 staff in our Fitzroy office. We are large enough to manage
complex projects and provide consistent service delivery yet small enough to
adapt and move quickly on changing project requirements.</p>

Over the years, we have identified new areas of client requirements and
developed services to meet those needs. These services on occasion have evolved
into new businesses in their own right. In 2002 and 2003 respectively, we
founded “IT Strategic” and “Websurvey”.
