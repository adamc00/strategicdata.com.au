    At Strategic Data, we pride ourselves on the intelligent application of information technology, providing services across all aspects of data collection, capture, processing, management and analysis.
    Established in Carlton in 1998, Strategic Data's team of around 20 people now work in our open-plan office among Johnston Street's Spanish bars and cafes just near Brunswick St in Fitzroy.
    Our programmers, administrative staff, techies, data entry operators, project managers, systems administrators work in a friendly and relaxed environment. We like to be around interesting, multi-skilled types, and we like to get involved in local IT community events.
  </p>
  <p>Having an in-house team of developers makes us distinctive and able to offer more services – with the potential to be more effective – for our clients.</p>
