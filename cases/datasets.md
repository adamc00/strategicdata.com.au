### Unlocking and uniting Australia’s cultural datasets

#### Client: Deakin University

#### Deliverable: <a href="https://huni.net.au/" target="_blank">HuNI</a>

##### Problem:

Australia has a great wealth of cultural datasets available to researchers.
Each of these datasets is unique, with its own target audience, its own
structure, and its own data and access priorities. Each dataset has been
designed specifically for its own data and audience and provides access to
highly curated data of an exceptionally high standard. Many of these datasets
are embedded in research practices and are used extensively in particular
disciplines. Beyond these direct disciplines, the existence of such rich
resources can often be relatively unknown. But the ability to search resources
that cross disciplines is of immense benefit to researchers.

##### Solution:

The Humanities Networked Infrastructure (HuNI) is a national Virtual
Laboratory project developed as part of the Australian government’s NeCTAR
(National e-Research Collaboration Tools and Resources) program. HuNI combines
information from 30 of Australia’s most significant cultural and creative arts
datasets. These datasets comprise more than 2 million authoritative records
relating to the people, organisations, objects and events that make up
Australia's rich cultural heritage. 

HuNI is a new research and discovery platform developed by and for
humanities and creative arts scholars. HuNI enables researchers to work with
and share this large-scale aggregation of cultural information. HuNI provides
discovery tools for casual users from the wider community. More sophisticated
functionality is available to researchers who register for an account in the
virtual laboratory.

Strategic Data provided partner technical support, infrastructure design,
software development, and product management services during the development of
the production HuNI Lab and maintained the data harvest toolchain. Deakin
University were keen to partner with Strategic Data due to our longstanding
history of working on complex data capture projects involving multiple
stakeholders and our ability to mesh human factor issues with intelligent
IT/database design.

##### Results:

The HuNI Virtual Laboratory is designed to support the nonlinear and
recursive research methods practiced in the humanities. HuNI provides discovery
tools for casual users from the wider community, but more sophisticated
functionality is available to researchers who register for an account in the
virtual laboratory. The HuNI VL enables researchers to create, save and publish
selections of data; to analyse and manipulate the data; share findings and to
export the data for reuse in external environments.

HuNI also enables researchers to assert relationships between records in the
form of ‘socially linked’ data which are visualised as a dynamic network graph.
This capability contributes to the building of a ‘vernacular’ network of
associations between HuNI records that recognise that there are diverse
perspectives on knowledge and amplify avenues for research discovery beyond
keyword and phrase searches.
