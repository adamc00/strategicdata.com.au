### Program monitoring and evaluation system 

#### Client: Federal Department of Health; University of Melbourne

#### Deliverable: Evaluation tool for de-identified consumer mental health information

##### Problem:

Access to Allied Psychological Services (ATAPS) is an initiative funded by the
Department of Health. ATAPS allows GPs to refer hard-to-reach people with
mild-to-moderate mental disorders to a mental health professional.<br>
Operating since 2001, the program is coordinated and managed by over 100
Divisions of General Practice and – since 2012 – by 61 Medicare Locals.

The Department of Health required monitoring and evaluation of the project in
order to provide:

* the level of uptake of the project (by GPs, other referrers, mental health professionals and consumers)
* a description of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of consumers
* an overview of the services consumers were receiving
* pre- and post-treatment consumer outcomes on standardised outcome measures.


The Department contracted the University of Melbourne’s Centre for Health
Policy, Programs and Economics for this evaluation work. In order to deliver
this contract, the University of Melbourne required a database to gather
common, basic information from all Divisions of General Practice implementing
ATAPS.

##### Solution:

In 2003, Strategic Data designed and implemented the Minimum Dataset – a
database that captures de-identified, consumer-level information. The database
is supported by a web interface, allowing Divisions of General Practice to
directly input or upload data collected by their referrers and mental-health
professionals.

The ATAPS program has expanded over the years and the Minimum Dataset has been
regularly updated to reflect these changes.

Password protected, the Minimum Dataset allows multiple users from each
Medicare Local to access only that Medicare Local’s information. It can also
generate reports to allow each Medicare Local to report back to the Department
of Health regularly. Strategic Data provides a Help Desk service for any
Medicare Local staff experiencing difficulties using the system.

The University of Melbourne is able to download data to produce periodic
aggregate reports for the Department of Health.

##### Results:

The ATAPS Minimum Dataset is not just a data system, but a strategically
designed application that can collect data from healthcare providers with a
broad range of IT systems and data collection methods.

Most impressively, it has weathered over ten years of changes in government
policy and direction. Strategic Data designed and delivered a well-constructed,
flexible application that has successfully adapted to the department’s evolving
requirements.

The success of the ATAPS MDS project is a result of the long-term embedded
partnership between the client, users and Strategic Data.
