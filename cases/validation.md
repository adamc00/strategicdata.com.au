### Online Data Validation

#### Client: The Australian Mental Health Outcomes and Classification Network (AMHOCN)

#### Deliverable: Government-to-government data transmission tool

##### Problem:

Since 1992, the National Mental Health Strategy has encouraged the development
of national outcome standards, as well as systems for assessing whether mental
health services are meeting these standards.

Analysis of the large data sets collected from Australian states and
territories revealed inconsistencies and errors. The AMHOCN had to undertake a
long manual process, working with the various jurisdictions, to resolve these
inconsistencies.

A new process of data validation was required to ensure this situation was not
repeated.

##### Solution:

Online Data Validator

The Online Data Validator is an extensible, web-based application for
determining the validity of large data sets. Its development grew out of our
strategic advice during the AMHOCN project.

Strategic Data provided (and still provides) the data bureau service
responsible for receiving and processing information. In the role of Data
Bureau, Strategic Data remains responsible for providing a system and process
to enable data receipting and validation to ensure National Outcome and Casemix
Collection (NOCC) data security, accountability and quality, and provides a
liaison service to the jurisdictions and the other AMHOCN components to resolve
data integrity issues.

The project involves:

* Data dictionary and associated data set specification 
* Receipting, verification and storage of the project data sets 
* Development of the Web Accessible Data Cube, Reports Portal and Decision Support Tool 
* Technical expertise with regard to the AMHOCN data sources to the AMHOCN components 
* Technical support and infrastructure for the AMHOCN website 

Strategic Data was able to bring broad contextual understanding, looking beyond
the immediate problem to ensure the new platform took into account future
requirements.

##### Results:

The AMHOCN and Online Data Validator applications are not just data systems,
but strategically designed applications that have weathered ten years of
changes in government policy and direction. They are well-constructed, flexible
applications that have been demonstrated to adapt to the department's evolving
requirements.

The value of the Online Data Validator is that very large data sets – such as
health records – can be efficiently and effectively examined for validity prior
to acceptance. This reduces errors, lowers costs, and improves the accuracy and
effectiveness of subsequent reporting and decision making.

The next level provides reports on data inconsistencies which the 'receiver'
can review and work through with the 'submitter' – all through the validation
tool so the decisions are recorded.<br /> Our partnership continues.
