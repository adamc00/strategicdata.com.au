  <h3>Report generation from multiple data sources </h3>
  <h4>Client: Government of Australia</h4>
  <h4>Deliverable: Automated print and web publishing process</h4>
  <h5 class="margin-top-lg">Problem:</h5>
  <p>
    The Australian Government required a comprehensive report to be prepared for print (200 pages) and web publishing. It entailed integrating dozens of data sources, preparing 150 or so charts and commenting on them.<br>
    Data – particularly that presented in charts – was constantly revised during the preparation of the report, so it was important to be able to update them efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>Both web and print documents needed to be kept in sync.</p>
  <h5>Solution:</h5>
  <p>Commonwealth Print and Web Report<br>
  Creating the final print and online report involved the development of three separate but integrated tools:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In consortium with content experts from the University of Melbourne, Strategic Data automated the extraction of data from the various data sources (including databases, spreadsheets and web resources).</li>
    <li>A second program built charts automatically from extracted data; if data changed the charts would always reflect those changes, not only speeding this process by orders of magnitude but reducing the chance of transcription errors being introduced.</li>
    <li>A third program built both the web and print versions automatically from all the component resources (ie the charts, tables and text) guaranteeing that both versions were identical</li>
  </ol>
  <h5>Results:</h5>
  <p>The published document (web and print) was generated moments after the final changes were made.</p>
  <p>Any future reports can reuse the automatic framework, requiring only that updated data is provided and new commentary is written. </p>
