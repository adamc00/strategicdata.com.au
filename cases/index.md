### Industry Data Tool

#### Client: Outdoor Power Equipment Association

#### Deliverable: Sales Monitoring Tool

##### Problem:

The Outdoor Power Equipment Association (OPEA) collected sales data from its
contributing members via spreadsheet. The data was then manually manipulated
into report format and distributed to each member. The process was
time-consuming and prone to errors. OPEA required a secure automated online
data collection tool to collect and report sales data across the industry. The
tool needed to be capable of:

* Secure collection of monthly data from subscribing companies by product
  category and sub groups.
* Consolidation of collected data into a monthly contributor report showing
  current month sales, year to date sales totals, and 12-month average sales
  for each product category.
* Generating a tailored industry report including a market summary overview to
  all subscribing companies enabling organisations to monitor their monthly
  performance against the industry as a whole.

##### Solution:

Strategic Data built a sales monitoring application that allows members to
upload monthly sales figures, automatically ensuring the datafile conforms to
the agreed specification. The application consolidates the member data in
industry-wide summaries, and presents tailored reports back to the member.
Messy existing data was merged and cleaned into the agreed format in order to
prepare the system for subsequent time series comparison with later data.
Contributing members are assured that the data they load is secure and
confidential.

##### Results:

Strategic Data’s Industry Data Tool provides a secure and confidential platform
for the submission and reporting of industry data.

The new system has been operating for 12 months. During that time there has
been a substantial improvement in the degree of completion and data accuracy.
The demands made of OPEA’s support staff have diminished as the system has
automatically rejected non-compliant data while instantly providing specific
feedback about what has caused it to fail. Over the months that the tool has
been in place contributors have found it increasingly easy to resolve issues
themselves. Strategic Data has provided any necessary helpdesk support,
ensuring that OPEA support staff no longer has to be involved with the cycle of
reviewing data, identifying errors, contacting contributors, explaining issues
and re-combining the datasets. In addition, the instant feedback provided by
the validation system significantly speeds up the process of ensuring errors
are identified and addressed.
