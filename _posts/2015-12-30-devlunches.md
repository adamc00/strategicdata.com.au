description: Quick recap of our developer lunches for 2015 and how they impacted future projects
---
# Background
Strategic Data has a range of different people from different technology backgrounds and expertise. Everyone is encouraged to learn new skills by attending conferences such as YOW and OSDC which we have previously sponsored. Participating in tertiary education courses through Perl Training Australia, UniSA, RMIT and Coursera. Finally by sharing our knowledge through developer lunches.

The developer lunches are a semi-formal way for developers to get together and present on certain topics or collaborate on programming courses. We take turns in organising them in order to change up the format. Prior to organising them myself they were done after attending conferences where people would do brief presentations on what they found interesting. As well as studying together such as the [Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive) and [R](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming) courses through coursea.

I organised 6 lunches from July through December 2014. Encouraging others to give presentations based off popular demand (and people dobbing others in to speak), giving some myself as well as organising guest speakers on topics of interest. I also maintained a [wiki](https://sdintra.net/Dev/DevLunches) where people could place resources of their talks as a reference. I found it was a great way to share information, encourage team building and promote a culture of collaboration.

# Developer Lunch Overviews

## 1. Topic: Presentations
As it was the first one I organised I decided to break the ice by presenting myself on the very meta topic of how to present a technology talk. As my background is more heavily situated in education rather than technology I thought to play to my strengths an discuss ways of presenting a topic so everyone can understand. This being a bit selfish as I hoped to encourage people to present topics in ways that I could understand them in future. As I had just started in IT and wanted to learn as much as possible.
It included tips on, how to structure your presentation, clear slide design, providing context, code demos and what to expect from giving a talk if you haven't done so before.

## 2. Topic 1: Dancer Topic 2: Accessibility
This time I shared the stage with Russell. He spoke on [Perl Dancer](https://gh.sdintra.net/raw/russellj/talks/master/dancer2/dancer150.md), a PERL Web Framework which he is involved in developing and maintaining. They had just released version 2 which involved a complete rewrite in some aspects, such as how the object oriententated stuff works, and many smaller bug fixes. It also had improvements in how it manages routes and multiple apps.
A number of applications developed and maintained by us use dancer as a base, so it's important that we maintain up-to-date knowledge.
I spoke on my work with improving our WebVal application to be more accessible for people with disabilities. I felt this was a good way to share what I had learnt about accessibility and to get more people on board with thinking about it when developing web applications themselves. I have started to see a shift as a result with more meetings including shout outs, by people who are not me, asking "yes, but is this accessible?"

## 3. Topic: Squitch
This month Steve spoke about [Squitch](https://gh.sdintra.net/raw/stephent/sqitch-talk/master/sqitch-talk.md) which is a way to create and modify databases and keep track of the changes that he was using in a project. Others were hoping to start to use it in their projects so he did an introduction on how it works and how to add it into a project.
It is a git like system that operates well with PERL though can work with other languages as well and supports all the major database types.
It went through the pros and cons of using it as well as having detailed code examples and live coding demonstrations. It has since started being used in other projects (mostly Dancer based, some others) throughout the business.

## 4. Topic: Docker
The month's topic was Docker presented by Toby. Docker has just started gaining momentum as a streamline alternative to virtual machines. We had heard about it when attending conferences and it was a good match to have a more in depth talk on how to implement and use Docker for our own projects. <watch presentation and add more notes here>
Since this talk we have moved to using docker more and more as a way of quickly setting up a testing environment on a local machine and workflow has improved dramatically.

## 5. Topic: Scala
We had a guest speaker this week, Ken from REA talking to us about Scala. REA has gone from using Perl, Ruby or Java to Scala on a number of projects. He went through the various aspects of the programming language, it's type system, similarities to other languages and what works really well.
Since then a couple of apps have been written in Scala, however it has not been widely adopted as yet.<ask toby about apps>

## 6. End of year wrap up
As it was the end of the year and I was just about to go on maternity leave the final developer lunch was a bit less formal, more of a celebratory wrap up. We had another guest from REA join us Luke, demonstrating the oculus rift. It attracted a wide range of people from the office and encouraged them all to have a look. It was interesting to have a go at a new technological tool and consider how it could be used on an enterprise level.
