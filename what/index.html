  <h3>Strategic planning</h3>
  <p>Our approach to strategic planning has two stages:</p>
  <h4>1. Define the problem</h4>
  <p>Accurately identifying your data issues is the first vital step in any change or improvement project.</p>
  <p><strong>Development projects:</strong> We partner with you to gain a comprehensive understanding of your issues, and determine a solution approach that best fits your needs.</p>
  <p><strong>Existing processes:</strong> We identify opportunities to refine and improve your existing data processes, including re-platforming, and developing online and mobile solutions.</p>
  <h4>2. Define the solution</h4>
  <p>Once the opportunity has been identified, we articulate and prioritise steps towards the ideal, creating a strategic plan that takes into account your organisational plans, market conditions, budgets, and emerging technologies.</p>
  <h3>Solution delivery</h3>
  <p>With the strategic work complete, skilled members of the Strategic Data team lead the 3-stage project implementation process.</p>
  <h4>1.	Build phase</h4>
  <p>From rapid application development to <strong><span style="color:#900">something else impressive</span></strong>, our technical team builds solutions that work. We manage project implementation and liaise regularly with your business and technical staff to make sure we're on track for the whole ride.</p>
  <h4>2.	Hosting</h4>
  <p>Because we host the client solutions we develop, we take great care to ensure everything is built with best-practice quality and efficiency. Strategic Data believes in real partnerships with our clients; we take responsibility for our work, and the secure systems that house it.</p>
  <h4>3.	Support</h4>
  <p>Support is more than simply fixing software glitches. At Strategic Data, we monitor the performance of our client solutions and help identify improvements and efficiencies. We stake our business on the quality of our staff, systems and project implementations, ensuring you realise the full potential of your data.</p>
